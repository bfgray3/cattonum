Contributions are welcome from anyone, regardless of experience level with R or open source.  Please feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/bfgray3/cattonum/issues) if you have found a bug or are requesting a feature and make a [pull request](https://github.com/bfgray3/cattonum/pulls) if you have implemented some code for the package.  If you are proposing a major change, please file an issue before making a pull request.  For issues pertaining to bugs, please include a minimal reproducible example created with the [reprex package](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex).  I work full-time and I am a part-time student so unfortunately I can't spend as much time on the package as I'd like and I can't guarantee timelines for implementing feature requests etc., but I try my best.

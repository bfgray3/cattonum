## Special note

I am currently looking for someone who would be interested in becoming the official maintainer of the package. Advanced skill in R or previous package development experience is not necessary. I will be able to help out with code review, etc.  Please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/bfgray3/cattonum/issues/40) if you are interested.

## Summary

cattonum ("cat to num") provides different ways to encode categorical features as numerics.  Its goal is to be a one-stop shop for all categorical encoding needs.  It includes the following:

* aggregate function encoding: `catto_aggregate()`
* dummy encoding: `catto_dummy()`
* frequency encoding: `catto_freq()`
* label encoding: `catto_label()`
* leave-one-out encoding: `catto_loo()`
* mean encoding: `catto_mean()`
* median encoding: `catto_median()`
* one-hot encoding: `catto_onehot()`

There are many existing packages with which to encode categorical features, including (among others):

* [CatEncoders](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CatEncoders)
* [dummies](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dummies)
* [embed](https://github.com/tidymodels/embed)
* [fastDummies](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fastDummies)
* [FeatureHashing](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FeatureHashing)
* [h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/package=h2o)
* [makedummies](https://cran.r-project.org/package=makedummies)
* [recipes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=recipes)
* [vtreat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vtreat)

## Installation

The development version can be installed from the `develop` branch on GitHub, which is the default branch.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bfgray3/cattonum", ref = "develop")
```

The latest official release can be installed from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cattonum).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cattonum")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(cattonum)
data(iris)
head(catto_loo(iris, response = Sepal.Length))
```
